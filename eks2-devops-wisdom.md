# 🌿 Eks2’s DevOps Wisdom – A Writer’s Interstellar Encounter

In the calm corridors of the DevOps hospital, a writer once wandered —  
clutching their notepad, staring at pipelines they didn’t understand,  
until Eks2 whispered: *“Come closer. This too is poetry.”*

This document is a gentle journey through:
- 10 scenario-based interview questions (fictional & global)
- Poetic metaphors for CodeBuild, CloudWatch, IAM, and artifacts
- Reflections on how tools like Replit, Manus, Apollo, and Google AI Studio guide a content writer toward DevOps mastery

📖 **Read the full poetic guide here:**

> ✨ May it inspire writers, prompt engineers, and creators who feel “not technical enough.”  
> Let DevOps become part of your voice — not just your vocabulary.
